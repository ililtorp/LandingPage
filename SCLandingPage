        I have struggled with multiples of allergies and eczema as long as I can remember. That's why I've always had to be caucious with the things I'm wearing and applying onto my skin. A random fact about me is that I'm allergic to the color <span style="color: red;"> <strong>red</strong></span>. This basically entails that I'm not able to wear red clothing, dye my hair red or get a tattoo with red ink. The verdict came from my dermathologist back in 2010, and he told me that I would have to wait at least 15 years until I could try patch test something red again. But to make a long story short I've had multiple flare ups due to reacting to fragrance in various products, wool, pollen etc. But as many of you know, finding the right skincare makeup etc. can
        be quite overwhelming, as it is a litteral jungle out there with products claming to be all natural - no chemicals, no nothing. I feel like we as comsumers is being held responsible for kind of doublechecking the ingredients and knowing which ingredients are good and bad for us. Luckily there are a few organizations out there working to make navigating this product jungle a little easier: The American non-profit EWG and the Danish Consumer Council. EWG (Environmental Working Group) is an American activist group that specializes in research and advocacy in the areas of agricultural subsidies, toxic chemicals, drinking water pollutants, and corporate accountability.
        In Denmark there is a similar organization fighting the same course as EWG, and that is the Danish Consumer Council (Da. Forbrugerr√•det T√¶nk). The Danish Consumer Council is an independent consumer organization that promote sustainable and social responsible consumerism and well-functioning markets in order to secure the rights of the consumers and give power to the consumers on the market.
